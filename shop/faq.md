# Frequently Asked Questions

### When will the Voltra Shop be open?

We are working towards our goal of 10 million tracks before we open the store.

### What kind of music will be in the Shop?

All kinds! The reason we are opening after 10 million is so that we can have a wide and diverse offering.

### Can I purchase lossless files through the Voltra Shop?

Yes, all music in the shop is available in lossless format as well as other standard lossy formats.

### What is Stream-to-Own?
Stream-to-own is a new concept that allows Voltra users to stream music affordably to decide if they like it. Listen once for free, and pay a small fee for each consecutive listen. After the 10th listen, you've fully paid for the track, and it's yours to keep!

More details coming when we officially launch the service.

### Why do I need a Voltra account to use stream-to-own?

In order for us to offer our stream-to-own service, you must have an account and we must have your credit card on file in order to process micro-transactions. Streams will be bundled and charged to your card once a large enough transaction amount is reached.

### When I buy an album, where does my money go?

When you purchase or "stream" anything on Voltra, your money goes directly to the artist! It doesn't get pooled and split based on popularity, and we don't take a cut of sales from indie artists.

### How do you make money?

We sell distributor and label catalogues where we do take a cut of sales, and we also offer **Premium** services for listeners and **Pro** services for artists. 

### I am an artist, how to I add my music?
