# Adding Music

Your Albums screen should have music in it, since your added your Music Directory already during sign up. If you would like to add more music, follow these steps.

The easiest way to add music is to add it to your chosen Music Directory, the watched folder where Voltra looks for changes.

If you would like to add a different file or folder, click **Edit > Add to Library** in the application menu. You can add as many folders as you like, and the app will reference these locations. *However, this is best if you do not plan on moving the file.*

You may also add media files by dropping them into the window, it will **copy** them to your chosen Music Directory.

Once you are finished adding your music, click **I'm Done** or close the window to continue. It will take you back to your **Collection** or **Album View** screen.

You may access this screen again at any time from the main menu with **File > Add To Library** or with the Open File shortcut ~~Cmd~~ + ~~O~~  < that's an O

## File Watching

If you add new music to the folder you set as your **Music Directory**, you won't need to add them again manually. Voltra will watch that folder, and adjust your data for you. You may need to restart the app to see your local changes.

To turn the file watcher on and off, go to **Profile > Settings**.

You can also change the location of your Music Directory here.
