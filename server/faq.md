# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it work?
The Voltra Music Server stores and syncs your music collection seamlessly with the Voltra desktop and mobile applications without the use of the cloud — stream your music directly from your home.

### How do I set it up?
1.  Plug it in via Ethernet cable to your modem or router, and into the wall using the power adapter.
2.  Connect with the Voltra Desktop Player to add your music.
3.  Connect with your mobile device to stream your music.

### How do I update the software?
The software will automatically update when connected to the internet.

### What is the warranty?
There is a 1-year limited warranty from the date of delivery that covers hardware issues. Contact Voltra Support to arrange for a replacement: support [at] voltra [dot] co

### Where do you ship to?
Shipping is included in the price, and we can ship anywhere in the world.

### What if I already have the Voltra Audio Archive?
The Voltra Music Server can be used alone or with the Voltra Audio Archive to ensure additional cloud music backup.

### I pre-ordered one, when will I get it?
We will begin shipping in Spring 2018.

### Can I use it for storage other than music?
Yes. The Voltra Music Server can be mounted just like any other network file system.

### What makes this different from a NAS?
It’s not just storage, it’s also a server with a protocol that replicates your meta data. This means the information that describes your music is properly updated when there are changes. When you access your music from any of your devices, the information is accurate.

### What type of internet is required?
The Voltra Music Server will work with any broadband connection — dial-up is not supported. Connect via Ethernet directly to your modem or router for the fastest access.

### Do I need a static IP address?
A static IP address is not required. Having one is nice, but if you don’t have one, we provide a network resolution service that you can use for free.

### What is the backup battery used for?
In the case that the Voltra Music Server loses power during an operation, there is a small backup battery that will protect it from corruption.
