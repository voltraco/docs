# Customization

You can find Customization and Account settings under your **Profile View**. Click the settings icon in the top right corner and navigate to the **Settings Tab**.

Here you will find application settings for colour, mode and your music directory settings.

## Accent Colour

You can also choose an accent colour. The default is Gold, but you can also select Red, Purple, Blue or Green.

## Dark Mode

There are two main color scheme options: **Dark** and **Light**
The default setting is light, but you can choose Dark and Voltra will remember your preference.

Here, I've changed to the Dark scheme with a Red accent.
