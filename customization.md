## Accent Colour

You can also choose an accent colour. The default is Gold, but you can also select Red, Purple, Blue or Green.

## Dark Mode

There are two main color scheme options: **Dark** and **Light**
The default setting is light, but you can choose Dark and Voltra will remember your preference.
