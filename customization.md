## Change Avatar

If you did not add your avatar during the sign up process, you can do it now. Simply click on the default avatar or drag your new image onto it.

## Select Home Directory

You can set or change your home directory here, by selecting a folder. Voltra will watch this folder for updates.

## Color Scheme

There are two main color scheme options: **Dark** and **Light**
The default setting is light, but you can choose Dark and Voltra will remember your preference.

You can also choose an accent colour. The default is gold, but you can also select Red, Purple, Blue or Green.

Here, I've changed to the Dark scheme with a Red accent.
