## Change Avatar

If you did not add your avatar during the sign up process, you can do it now. Simply click on the default avatar or drag your new image onto it.

## Themes

## File Watching

File watching is on by default, and the toggle is disabled in the beta version. In a later release, you will be able to turn this feature on and off.
