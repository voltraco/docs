In the Voltra desktop app, your Collection is the home screen. This page explains how to navigate the app and how to control music playing.

## Menu

The main navigation is located in the top right corner. It is used to switch the **View**. Several icons are shown, they are, in order:

**Album View** — **Artist View** — **Playlist View** — **Search** — **Profile / Account**

These menu icons can be accessed from any **View**.

## Album View

When you hover over an album, you will see an overlay with three icons. From the left:

**Number of Tracks** — **Play Button** — **Menu Button**

## Play Album

When you hover over an album or track with your cursor, the **Play Button** becomes visible.

Clicking the **Play Button** will play the album or track immediately.

If you have just started the app, clicking a **Play Button** anywhere in the app will bring up the bottom **Control Bar** for the first time.

## Pause

Now that you are playing a track and the **Control Bar** is visible, you can now **Pause** or by hitting the pause button in the bottom left corner. Resume a song by hitting the same button (which should now be a play button instead).

**Hint:** You can also Play and Pause with the shortcut ~~Space~~

## Skip

To skip a song, use the **Skip** keys in the **Control Bar**, or the shortcut ~~Cmd~~ + ~~Left Arrow~~ or ~~Right Arrow~~

You can also use the Media Keys on your keyboard to control music.

## View Album

To view an album, click on the image (anywhere other than the play or menu buttons) or the album name.

## Play Next

If you would like to play something immediately after what is currently playing, you can **Play Next**. This can be accessed by the **Context Menu**.

**Play Next** will place the item in the **[Queue](https://voltra.co/docs/queue/)** after the current song.

## Add to Queue

**Add to Queue** will place the item at the end of the **[Queue](https://voltra.co/docs/queue/)**.

## Control Bar

In the **Control Bar**, you can pause, play, or skip the current track.

It also shows you the:

- progress bar
- track name
- album name
- artist name
- current / total length
- open queue arrow

The **Progress Bar** shows you the current position of the playing track. Hovering anywhere on the control bar will bring up a handle on the **Progress Bar**, allowing you to drag to a different position.

Clicking on the open **Queue** arrow (far-right), or anywhere else on the control bar will open the **Queue**.

## Volume

The volume control is found in the control bar in the bottom right. Hover to see volume level and click and drag to adjust.
