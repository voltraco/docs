# Queue View

The Queue shows you what you are currently playing, what you've already played, and everything that will play in the (near) future. The queue shows the current track (left side), and a list of upcoming tracks (right side).

## Open Queue

To open the queue, click on the **Control Bar**.  

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut ~~Q~~ or the **up arrow**.

## Add to Queue

To add something to the **Queue**, right-click on an album, track or playlist to add it to the end of the queue, or select **Play Next** to add it after the current song.

**Hint:** To play something immediately, just click the play button to add it to the top of the queue.

## Currently Playing

The large cover image on the left is the currently playing track.

Hovering over the large image on the current track will show the same **Context Menu** as an Album or Track in any other view.
