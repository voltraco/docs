# Cloud Sync
Voltra offers a cloud sync service that allows you to back up all of your music files, images and metadata. In order to sync your data to the cloud, you need to have a **Voltra Premium** account.

## Upgrade to Premium
To upgrade your account to premium from within the app:

1.  Navigate to the **Settings View**
2.  Click on the **Account** tab
3.  Under **Subscription Type** your current subscription is listed
4.  If you have no subscription, click **Change** to upgrade to **Voltra Premium**

## Turn Sync on/off
_Sync must first be activated_

To turn Sync on or off:
1.  Navigate to the **Settings View**
2.  Click on the **Sync** tab
3.  Under **Sync**, click the toggle to turn **ON** (or **OFF** if it is already on)

## Synced Items
If you have sync turned on and all your tracks and albums are synced to the cloud, you will not see any visual indicators. You can see what it synced by changing the [Display](/desktop/sync.html#change-sync-display).

## Cloud Only
When something **exists in the cloud but not on your computer**, you will see a small cloud icon near the item indicating it is **cloud only**.

If you delete a cloud only item, it will be deleted permanently from the cloud and you do not have a local backup.

## Change Sync Display
1.  Navigate to the **Settings View**
2.  Click on the **Sync** tab
3.  Under **Display**, choose what you would like to show

If you would like to see all of your music (default), select **All Music**.

If you would like to see the music that you have _only_ on your computer (not synced to the cloud yet), select **Music only on this computer**

If you would like to see music that is _only_ in the cloud and not on your computer, select **Music only in the cloud**

If you would like to see what the status of your synced items is, select **Synced Music**

## Resync
Resync will tell Voltra to pull down a fresh version of your cloud data.

How to Resync:
1.  Navigate to the **Settings View**
2.  Click on the **Sync** tab
3.  Under **Resync**, click the **Resync** button
