## Import Music

After signing in for the first time or creating a new account, you will be asked to select a media directory.


### Select Directory
Choose the folder where your music is kept, and Voltra will use this as your **Media Directory**. Voltra will watch this folder for any changes, such as new files, changes or deletions as long as file watching is turned on.

If you want to start fresh, create a new folder and make it your home directory. Any files you drop into the player will add and copy to this new location.

1.  Click **Select Directory**.
2.  Choose the folder you would like to add music from.
3.  Voltra will begin importing files from this folder. Import progress is shown on screen.
4.  Click **Finish** to continue.

<p class="note">Not sure which folder to use? You can select your iTunes directory or the standard Music directory on your computer.</p>


### Find Music
Once you have selected your **Media Directory**, you can still add music from other folders.

1.  Go to **File → Find Music** to open the Import screen.
2.  Click **Find Music**.
3.  Choose the folders or files you would like to add.
4.  If you are done adding music, click **Finish**.

This method is best if you want to pick and choose what you would like to add, but do not plan on moving the files. Voltra will link to files outside the **Media Directory**, and the links will be broken if the files are moved.

<p class="note">You can also open the Import screen with `⌘O` on Mac and `^O` on Windows/Linux.</p>


### Drag and Drop
Voltra also allows you to quickly import music files with drag and drop.

1.  Drag a file onto the window (anywhere but inside an existing input).
2.  Files will be imported, and copied to your **Media Directory**.

Note: You can only import via drag and drop if you have already selected a **Media Directory**. If you have no Media Directory, you will be asked to choose one.


### Watch Folder
The **Media Directory** you selected is also your **Watch Folder**. Voltra will watch this folder for changes. You can easily add music to Voltra by adding it directly to this folder.

<p class="note">To use this feature, make sure the File Watcher is turned on: **Settings → Preferences → File Watcher**</p>
