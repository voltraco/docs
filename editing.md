## Editing Tags

(*not yet supported*)

You can edit tracks with the **Tag Editor**. It can be accessed through the track menu or album menu. A tag editor dialog will allow you to make edits to the track.

The tag editor can be used to correct incorrect metadata. It will edit the files themselves, not just your data associated with the app.
