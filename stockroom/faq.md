### What is stream-to-own?
Stream-to-own allows Voltra users to stream music affordably to decide if they like it. They may listen once for free, and then pay a small fee for each consecutive listen. After the 10th listen, once they have fully paid for the track, they may download it.

### How do song previews work?
We offer standard, 30-second previews to consumers. We recommend that your track be more than 30 seconds long, longer than the length of a preview.

If the customer is using stream-to-own to purchase your music, they will get to listen to the song one time for free.
