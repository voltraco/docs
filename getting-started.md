# Getting Started

Here's what you'll need to do after you download and install the Voltra desktop app.

## Set Home Directory

After installing and opening the desktop app, you will be asked to choose your **Home Directory**. It will try to detect the default music folder on your computer. If you store your music somewhere else, you can change it now. (Don't worry, you can always change it later.)

Voltra will watch this folder for any changes, such as new files, changes or deletions.

Note: If you want to start fresh, create a new folder and make it your home directory. Any files you drop into the player will add and copy to this new location.

## Sign up and Verify

To use Voltra player, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You must verify yourself with a mobile phone number (via SMS). *This is how we know you're for real.* We may later also ask you to verify your email address.

If you don't receive the code, click "I didn't get a text!" to return to the previous screen to change your number.

Success! You're registered.
