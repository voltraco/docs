# Getting Started

Here's what you'll need to do after you download and install the Voltra desktop app.

## Add Music / Choose Music Directory

After installing and opening the desktop app, you will be asked to add music. Choose the folder where your music is kept to use it as your **Music Directory**. Voltra will watch this folder for any changes, such as new files, changes or deletions.

Note: If you want to start fresh, create a new folder and make it your home directory. Any files you drop into the player will add and copy to this new location.
