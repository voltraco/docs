# Cloud ``coming soon``

Cloud settings can be found in the cloud tab of the profile section.

If you have a free account, you will not see any cloud settings and/or they will be disabled.

## Cloud Storage

When you upgrade to a **Monthly Subscription**, your music files (up to **125 GB**) will start to upload to the cloud. You can control the frequency and conditions of this under **Settings**, below.

With this upgrade, you can use the Voltra mobile app to Stream your collection, or Sync it to listen offline.

If you choose to keep your files only in the **Cloud** instead of locally, you will be able to stream them whenever you have internet access.
