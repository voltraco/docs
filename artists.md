# Artists

To view all your albums by artist, select the **Artist View** icon from the top menu. 

To view a specific artist, click on the artist name wherever you see a link to it in the app (i.e. under an Album name or on the Currently Playing track.) It will bring you to the **Artist View** with the current artist selected.

## Artist List

To the left of the **Artist View** is a list of all the artists associated with albums in your collection, in alphabetical order. The top of list shows your Compilations (anything with more than one artist) and albums with an Unknown Artist.

Select one to view the albums in your collection by that artist.

## Filter Artists

The search bar at the top of the artist list allows you to filter the list by letter or name.

Click the **X** to exit filter.

## Rename Artist

The artist name is collected from your **Album** data. If there are any errors with the artist name, this issue is with the album itself, and must be edited there with the **[Tag Editor](https://voltra.co/docs/editing/)**

## Artist Info

Each artist page shows you a short biography (if it can find one), and a list of the albums in your collection by the selected artist (currently sorted Alphabetically). From here, you can open each album or album menu, or play an album.

To **Play All** songs by this artist, hit the play all button at the top of the Albums section.

## Artist Image

The default artist image is the first album in the list by that artist.

You can add your own image to each artist page by clicking the **Edit** button (accessed by hovering over the top image, in the top right corner).

You can also drag an image onto the current artist image to replace it.
