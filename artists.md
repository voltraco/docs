## Edit Artist Name

The artist name is collected from your **Album** data. If there are any errors with the artist name, this issue is with the album itself, and must be edited there with the **[Tag Editor](https://voltra.co/docs/editing/)**.

## Edit Artist Image

The default artist image is the first album in the list by that artist.

You can add your own image to each artist page by clicking the **Edit** button (accessed by hovering over the top image, in the top right corner).

You can also drag an image onto the current artist image to replace it.
