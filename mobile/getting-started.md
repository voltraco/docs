Here you can pause/play the playback or tap (or pull) to open the **Queue**.

### Play/Pause

To **Play** a track simply tap on it, the Control Bar will immediately change and the audio will start playing. For tracks with a cloud icon next to them this may take few seconds depending on your connectivity.
