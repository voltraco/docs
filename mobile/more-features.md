## Lossless File Support

Voltra Mobile Player currently only supports FLAC as a lossless audio file format. This is restricted to iPhone 7 or newer devices but we are working on supporting it on older devices.

## Offline Mode

With poorer internet connectivity it is possible to switch to **Offline Mode**. Once enabled you will be able to only browse music that is **Synced Offline** onto your device. To toggle this mode tap on the **Offline Mode** switch in **Settings**.

## Dark Mode

You can enable **Dark Mode** by tapping the **Dark Mode** switch in the **Settings** view.
